# Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

Algorithm used :- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

# Observations
Using Petals over Sepal for training the data gives a much better accuracy.
